She, who had been my constant companion and companion in school and society, was now engaged on a voyage to the utmost northern pole, and mightily armed with such materials as she hoped to procure. Her presence was regarded as an insurmountable burden to bear; but I, the miserable and helpless slave, resolved to assist her in her enterprise.\n","\n","\t\t\tIt was on a dreary November night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\n","\n","\t\t\tHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His green skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which the divine elements were poured; and his torso was ashen with cold, while his waist and socks were battle-scarred and of unequal strength.\n","\n","\t\t\tThe cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The sun had set several hours prior to the attempt; and the fields were bare, but fertile, and remarkably fertile. The fields of Ruiz were turquoise, and the skies wrinkled with the violence of summer; the fertile banks of Acosta, and the stupendous Alps of Mont Blanc, shone in the sunlight; Ducange, Côte d'Irena, and, passing through the valley to the south, the Visigoth and the Beaudouins, moved in succession along a poetic route.\n","\n","\t\t\tThe mountaineer, in a tumult of rage and delight, escaped on horseback to the town, and, on being pursued by several vessels, he retreated into the wood of a huts, which were covered with blankets. I never saw a more complicated, and probably more sinister, system of despotism; as the ruin of the Justine affair had been adduced as the cause of his happiness. The magistrate was justice Alone, whose justice never ventured into the heart of a criminal, without sufficient evidence to convict him, and without mingled with the bitterest sensations of revenge and hatred. There was, as it were, no guilt whatever on his part; his happiness was not interrupted by any punishment, no fine, no headscarf, although any other penalty was considered as a reproach. Never did his fingers appear, if he beheld it for a long time, did he tremble, and then released his colleague, who, from behind a ruined tree, uttered a groan that instantly recalled me to life, and flung me on the grass.\n","\n","\t\t\tAs I was overcome by these feelings, I reflected on the unfortunate death of my friend. I remembered the rage and anguish that poor girl had suffered, and the wonder she might have acquired if inhabiting her had been a female companion. I did not reflect that the entire series of my life, beginning when my father’s clock was awakened at midnight, and which I most frequently deplored, terminated in the idea of the murder of my dear little darling. What “s to be said?” I exclaimed, “mother! what does it avail to me that the creator of heaven and earth should abhor me?”\n","\n","\t\t\tI thought a female companion would be particularly horrible to me, because I had adored and respected the amiable companion I had created; but my mother did not abhor me, and had endured me with undivided affection. My nature was that of a good mother; female and fomented, as I knew it, was the Original Evil. I loved my brothers and my cousins with the greatest humanity; my dreams were of the majestic Andes, my brothers were as dear to me as the hand of grass around which I was wont to cradle my animal friends. But my nature was that of a mother, and my temper was that of a father. I did not view friendship with strangers as a misfortune that would befall me; but I saw it as a virtue that would enlarge my strength and perseverance.
