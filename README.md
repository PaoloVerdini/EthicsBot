# EthicsBot
Fine-tuned Gpt-2 "ethics" model

These two colab notebooks will allow you to train and test your own EthicsBot! It is advisable that you download the two files:

"Train_a_GPT_2_Text_Generating_Model.ipynb" will fine-tune your model with the dataset of your choice (you can download and use the "all_ai_novels.txt" in the repository.

"AI_Ethics_Bot.ipynb" will make you try the EthicsBot yourselves. You can run this notebook without the other one (the Bot will be, therefore, not fine-tuned).
